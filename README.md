# AES Traits Webapp

Simple boilerplate for a Flask backend and React client including:

* ES6 transpiling via Webpack
* Hot module reloading via Webpack Dev Server
* State management via Redux
* Tests via Pytest and Jest
* Linting via Pylint and Eslint
* Travis CI for automatic testing and linting

## Dependencies

To install the boilerplate dependencies, you can run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/robert1ridley/cross-prompt-trait-aes-app.git
cd cross-prompt-trait-aes-app
npm install --no-optional
conda env create --file environment.yml
```

## Quickstart

The app utilizes a SQL database. To populate it, run:

```bash
npm run pop-database
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the api with the following command:

```bash
npm run production
```

That will start the server on port 7082. To run the development server with hot module reloading, run:

```bash
npm run start
```

That will start the webpack dev server on port 7081.
